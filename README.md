Here‚Äôs the updated `UI/UX Design Planning` section for your `README.md`, including the color styles and typography from the Figma file you shared, as well as an explanation on the importance of identifying design properties:

## üß© UI/UX Design Planning

### üé® Color Styles

The following color styles were used to ensure visual consistency and brand alignment across the application:

- **Primary Color:** `#FF385C` ‚Äì used for CTAs (Call-To-Action), buttons, and highlights
- **Secondary Color:** `#717171` ‚Äì used for supporting text and icons
- **Background Color:** `#FFFFFF` ‚Äì base canvas for clean and clear presentation
- **Border Color:** `#DDDDDD` ‚Äì used for dividing UI elements softly
- **Accent Color:** `#F7F7F7` ‚Äì light gray for subtle background sections

### ‚úíÔ∏è Typography

The design utilizes a consistent typographic system to create hierarchy and readability:

- **Font Family:** `Circular Std` (or system fallback: `sans-serif`)
- **Headings (H1‚ÄìH3):**

  - Font Weight: **Bold (700)**
  - Font Size: **32px**, **24px**, **20px**

- **Body Text:**

  - Font Weight: **Regular (400)**
  - Font Size: **16px**

- **Captions/Small Text:**

  - Font Weight: **Regular (400)**
  - Font Size: **12px‚Äì14px**

> _Note: Where `Circular Std` is unavailable, substitute with `Inter` or `Poppins` for web compatibility._

### üìÑ Page Descriptions

| Page Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Property Listing View** | Displays a collection of properties in a card/grid layout. Each card includes a thumbnail image, property name, price, and a ‚ÄúView Details‚Äù button.           |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Shows comprehensive information about a selected property, including a gallery of images, detailed descriptions, amenities, reviews, and a "Book Now" button. |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | A clean form where users can input booking details such as dates, guest info, and payment options. Confirmation message displayed after booking.              |

### üß† Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Identifying and documenting the **design properties** (like color palette, typography, spacing, and component styles) in a mockup ensures:

- ‚úÖ **Consistency:** Uniform styling across the app, enhancing the user experience and brand identity
- üõ†Ô∏è **Developer Efficiency:** Clear reference reduces guesswork and speeds up implementation
- üì± **Responsive Design:** Informed decisions on spacing, scaling, and alignment across screen sizes
- üéØ **User-Centered Focus:** Aligns the development output with the user‚Äôs visual expectations and accessibility standards

In summary, treating your Figma mockup as a **single source of truth** strengthens collaboration between designers and developers while helping you build with confidence.
